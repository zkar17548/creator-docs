      Pitch will make audio sound higher or lower. The default value is 1, representing no
    change to the pitch. Lower values result in lower sounds, while higher values produce
    higher sounds. Valid values are from .01 to 2.

    summary: |
      A range from which a random value will be selected and applied to the pitch when playing.
    A value between [-randomPitch, randomPitch] will be added to the pitch when playing.
    The default value is 0, meaning no change to the pitch. Valid values are between 0 and 1.
