name: GameObject
type: classes
summary: |
  In Unity, a GameObject refers to an object existing in your game's world -- everything from
    characters, buildings, landscapes, to lights, cameras, and more can be GameObjects. It acts as
    encompassing container or entity that could carry multiple types of components that dictate how
    this GameObject behaves and interacts in your game.
    A GameObject can be as simple as a single point of light in a dark room or as complex as a
    character with AI-driven behaviors, interactive elements, physical properties, etc. It just
    depends on what kind of components you attach to it. Examples of components include scripts
    (pieces of code that dictate GameObject behavior), physics components like Rigidbodies or
    Colliders, audio sources, and much more.
    Understanding GameObjects is vital to building anything in Unity, as they comprise the
    functional elements of all scenes, mechanics, and interactions within the game engine. For more
    extensive understanding, consider perusing the [official Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.html).

    summary: |
      The `activeSelf` property indicates whether the GameObject is active in the scene or not.
    If a GameObject is inactive, it will not be rendered and will not trigger any of its script
    events. For more information, visit the [official Unity documentation.](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject-activeSelf.html)

    summary: |
      The `GetComponent` method allows you to access a component attached to the GameObject, if
    it exists. This includes built-in components like a Transform or Collider, or custom
    scripts that you've written. For more information, refer to [Unity's official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponent.html).
